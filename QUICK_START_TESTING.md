# Quick Start - Testing HashPack Connection

## ✅ Build Complete!

The application has been rebuilt with improved HashPack connection handling. New files generated:
- `dist/assets/index.B69lo3Ds.js` 
- `dist/assets/main.DYPAEbyV.js`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
**IMPORTANT**: You're still loading old files. Clear your browser cache:
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
- **Firefox**: `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows)
- Or use Incognito/Private mode

### 2. Serve the New Build

Choose one option:

**Option A: Preview the production build**
```bash
npm run preview
```

**Option B: Development mode (with hot reload)**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Verify HashPack Setup

Before connecting, ensure:
- ✅ HashPack extension is installed from [hashpack.app](https://www.hashpack.app/)
- ✅ HashPack wallet is **unlocked**
- ✅ HashPack is set to **Testnet** (not Mainnet)
  - Click the HashPack extension
  - Check the network dropdown in top-right
  - Switch to "Testnet" if needed

### 4. Test the Connection

1. **Open the app** in your browser
2. **Open DevTools Console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. **Click "Connect HashPack"**
4. **Watch the console** for these new messages:

   **✅ Best case (Direct Extension)**:
   ```
   Attempting to connect to HashPack...
   🔄 Trying direct HashPack extension connection...
   ✅ HashPack extension detected
   ✅ Connected via HashPack extension: 0.0.xxxxx
   ```

   **✅ Fallback case (Relay Server)**:
   ```
   Attempting to connect to HashPack...
   🔄 Trying direct HashPack extension connection...
   Direct connection failed, trying HashConnect relay...
   🔄 Initializing HashConnect relay...
   ✅ HashConnect relay initialized
   ```

5. **Approve the connection** in HashPack popup

## 🔍 What Changed?

### New Connection Flow

```
1. Try Direct Extension API (NEW!)
   ↓ (if fails)
2. Try HashConnect Relay Server
   ↓ (with 10s timeout instead of 60s)
3. Show detailed error message
```

### Benefits

- **Faster**: Direct extension bypasses slow relay server
- **More Reliable**: Doesn't depend on `wss://hashconnect.hashpack.app/`
- **Better Errors**: Clear messages explain what went wrong
- **Automatic Fallback**: Tries multiple methods automatically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still seeing WebSocket errors?

The new code tries to bypass the relay server entirely. If you still see WebSocket errors in console, they should now be **non-blocking** - the connection should still work via the direct extension method.

### "HashPack extension not found"?

1. Install from [hashpack.app](https://www.hashpack.app/)
2. Refresh the page
3. Try again

### Connection still timing out?

1. Make sure HashPack is **unlocked**
2. Verify you're on **Testnet** network in HashPack
3. Check for **popup blockers**
4. Try clicking the **HashPack extension icon** directly
5. Hard refresh the page (`Cmd+Shift+R`)

### Error: "HashConnect relay server may be down"?

This means:
- The direct extension connection didn't work
- The relay server is also unavailable
- This is a temporary infrastructure issue

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Try restarting your browser
- Check if HashPack extension needs an update

## 📊 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when you see:
1. ✅ Success toast notification
2. Your Hedera account ID displayed
3. Console shows: `✅ Connected via HashPack extension` OR `✅ Pairing successful`

## 📝 Report Back

After testing, please share:
1. Which connection method worked? (Direct or Relay)
2. Any console errors you see
3. Whether the connection succeeded
