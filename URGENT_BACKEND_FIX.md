# üö® URGENT: Backend CORS Fix Required

## The Problem
Your frontend is deployed and working, but the **backend is rejecting all requests** due to CORS policy.

**Error Message:**
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://hedera-ramp.onrender.com/api/public/stats' 
from origin 'https://hedera-ramp.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## ‚úÖ The Fix (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Open: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Find your backend service (likely named `hedera-ramp-backend` or similar)

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable
1. Click on your backend service
2. Click "Environment" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add Environment Variable"
4. Add the following:
   - **Key:** `CORS_ORIGINS`
   - **Value:** `https://hedera-ramp.vercel.app,https://hedera-ramp-hub.vercel.app,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080`
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Step 3: Wait for Automatic Redeploy
- Render will automatically redeploy your backend (takes 2-3 minutes)
- Watch the logs to ensure deployment succeeds
- Look for: "Deploy live"

## How to Verify It's Fixed

### Option 1: Check Browser Console
1. Go to https://hedera-ramp.vercel.app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Refresh the page
4. You should see stats loading without CORS errors

### Option 2: Test API Directly
Run this in your terminal:
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://hedera-ramp.vercel.app" -v https://hedera-ramp.onrender.com/api/public/stats
```

**Expected Response Headers:**
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://hedera-ramp.vercel.app
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
```

## Alternative Method (If Environment Variable Doesn't Work)

### Use Render's Blueprint
1. Go to your backend service on Render
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. This will pick up the `render.yaml` file that already has the CORS configuration

## What Happens After Fix

‚úÖ Landing page will load stats correctly
‚úÖ Charts will display transaction data
‚úÖ Recent transactions will show
‚úÖ Wallet connect will attempt to work (separate issue to fix after)
‚úÖ No more CORS errors in console

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Frontend deployed successfully
- ‚úÖ Frontend using correct backend URL
- ‚úÖ Error handling working
- ‚ùå **Backend CORS blocking requests** ‚Üê YOU ARE HERE
- ‚è≥ Wallet connection has a separate issue (will fix after CORS)

---

**DO THIS NOW** - Without this fix, the entire application is unusable in production.
