# HashPack Connection Fixes

## Issues Addressed

The application was experiencing connection issues with HashPack wallet due to:
1. Incorrect HashConnect initialization
2. Attempting to use non-existent HashPack direct API
3. Complex connection flow with unnecessary fallback logic

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified HashConnect Initialization (`src/context/WalletContext.tsx`)

- **Removed Incorrect Direct API Call**: Removed `connectHashPackDirect()` function that tried to call non-existent `hashpackExtension.connectToExtension()` API
- **Simplified Constructor**: Updated HashConnect initialization to use default constructor:
  ```typescript
  const hashconnect = new HashConnect();
  ```
- **Proper Initialization Flow**: Fixed the init-then-connect flow:
  1. Initialize HashConnect with app metadata
  2. Set up pairing event listener BEFORE calling connect
  3. Call connect() to trigger HashPack popup
- **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks with specific error messages for initialization vs connection failures
- **Increased Timeout**: Extended connection timeout to 60 seconds to give users more time to approve
- **Improved Logging**: Added detailed console logs at each step for debugging

### 2. Simplified Connection Flow (`src/components/WalletConnect.tsx`)

- **Removed Dual Handler**: Removed `handleDirectConnect()` and consolidated to single `handleWalletConnect()` handler
- **Fixed Auth Timing**: Added delay to ensure wallet state is updated before authentication
- **Better Error Categorization**: Categorized errors by type:
  - **Connection Timeout**: When user doesn't approve in time
  - **HashPack Not Found**: When extension isn't installed
  - **Initialization Failed**: When HashConnect fails to load
- **Enhanced UI Feedback**: Updated status message to show HashPack detection status
- **Extended Toast Duration**: Error messages display for 12 seconds with detailed troubleshooting steps

## Testing the Fix

### Prerequisites
1. Install HashPack wallet extension from [hashpack.app](https://www.hashpack.app/)
2. Create or import a Hedera wallet
3. **Important**: Switch HashPack to **Testnet** network

### Testing Steps

1. **Build and serve the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   # Or for development:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application** in your browser

3. **Verify HashPack is ready**:
   - Unlock HashPack wallet
   - Confirm it's on Testnet network (check the network dropdown in HashPack)

4. **Attempt connection**:
   - Click "Connect HashPack" button
   - Watch the browser console for debug logs:
     - `"Attempting to connect to HashPack..."`
     - `"HashConnect init attempt X/3..."`
     - `"‚úÖ HashConnect initialized successfully"`
     - `"Calling hashconnect.connect()..."`
   
5. **Look for HashPack popup**:
   - A HashPack approval popup should appear
   - If it doesn't appear, check:
     - Popup blockers
     - Click the HashPack extension icon
     - Browser console for errors

6. **Approve the connection**:
   - Click "Approve" in the HashPack popup
   - You should see:
     - `"‚úÖ Pairing successful:"`
     - Success toast notification
     - Your wallet address displayed

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: WebSocket Connection Still Failing

**Possible Causes**:
1. HashConnect relay server is temporarily down
2. Network/firewall blocking WebSocket connections
3. Browser extensions interfering

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Try disabling VPN/proxy temporarily
- Disable browser extensions that might block WebSockets
- Wait and try again later (server may be experiencing issues)
- Check HashPack service status

#### Issue: No Popup Appears

**Solutions**:
- Check for popup blockers
- Click the HashPack extension icon directly
- Ensure HashPack is unlocked
- Refresh the page and try again

#### Issue: Connection Timeout

**Solutions**:
- Ensure HashPack is on **Testnet** network (not Mainnet)
- Make sure HashPack is unlocked
- Close and reopen HashPack
- Try clearing browser cache and localStorage

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging by opening Browser DevTools Console. You'll see:
- HashConnect initialization attempts
- Connection state changes
- Pairing events
- Error details

### Expected Console Output (Success)

```
Starting wallet connection...
üîÑ Attempting to connect to HashPack...
üîÑ Initializing HashConnect...
‚úÖ HashConnect initialized: {topic: "...", pairingString: "..."}
üîÑ Calling hashconnect.connect() to open HashPack...
HashConnect.connect() returned: {topic: "..."}
‚úÖ Pairing successful: {accountIds: ["0.0.xxxxx"], ...}
Wallet connected, wallet state: {isConnected: true, accountId: "0.0.xxxxx", ...}
Authenticating with accountId: 0.0.xxxxx
```

### Expected Console Output (Initialization Failure)

```
Starting wallet connection...
üîÑ Attempting to connect to HashPack...
üîÑ Initializing HashConnect...
‚ùå HashConnect initialization failed: Error: ...
Wallet connection failed: Error: Failed to initialize HashConnect. Please:
1. Make sure HashPack is installed from hashpack.app
2. Unlock your HashPack wallet
3. Refresh the page and try again
```

### Expected Console Output (Connection Timeout)

```
Starting wallet connection...
üîÑ Attempting to connect to HashPack...
üîÑ Initializing HashConnect...
‚úÖ HashConnect initialized: {topic: "...", pairingString: "..."}
üîÑ Calling hashconnect.connect() to open HashPack...
HashConnect.connect() returned: {topic: "..."}
(after 60 seconds)
Wallet connection failed: Error: HashPack connection timeout. Please:
1. Make sure HashPack is unlocked
2. Switch to Testnet network
3. Check for popup blockers
4. Click the HashPack extension icon
```

**Note**: The simplified connection flow uses only the official HashConnect library without custom direct API calls.

## Additional Improvements

If WebSocket issues persist, consider:

1. **Alternative Connection Methods**: Implement direct HashPack extension API connection as a fallback
2. **Custom Relay Server**: Set up your own HashConnect relay server
3. **Update HashConnect**: Monitor for updates to `@hashgraph/hashconnect` that may fix relay issues
4. **Blade Wallet Support**: Add support for Blade wallet as an alternative

## Files Modified

- `src/context/WalletContext.tsx` - Enhanced HashConnect initialization with retry logic
- `src/components/WalletConnect.tsx` - Improved error handling and user instructions

## Next Steps

1. Test the connection with HashPack on Testnet
2. Monitor console logs for any new errors
3. If WebSocket issues persist, consider implementing HashPack extension direct API as a fallback
4. Update error messages based on user feedback

## Notes

- The WebSocket connection to HashConnect relay server is a known point of failure
- The relay server (`wss://hashconnect.hashpack.app/`) may experience downtime
- These improvements add resilience but cannot fix server-side issues
- Debug mode is enabled to help diagnose connection issues
