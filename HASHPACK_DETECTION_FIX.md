# 🔧 HashPack Detection Fix - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

Fixed HashPack detection issues in the Hedera Ramp Hub app by implementing modern detection methods that don't rely on window injection.

## 🔄 **Changes Made**

### **1. Vite Configuration (vite.config.ts)**
```typescript
server: {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5173,
  https: true, // Enable HTTPS for HashPack compatibility
},
```

**Why**: HashPack extension requires HTTPS for proper detection and communication. This ensures the app runs over HTTPS in development mode.

### **2. Modern HashPack Detection (useHashConnect.tsx)**

**Old Approach (Problematic):**
```typescript
// Relied on window injection - unreliable
const isAvailable = !!(
  window.hashconnect ||
  window.HashConnect ||
  window.hashpack
);
```

**New Approach (Robust):**
```typescript
// Method 1: Check extension manifest
const manifest = chrome.runtime.getManifest();
if (manifest?.name?.toLowerCase().includes('hashpack')) {
  return true;
}

// Method 2: Check for HashPack extension ID
await chrome.runtime.sendMessage('nldfohamknppdpanbekagnnghnadjnde', { action: 'ping' });

// Method 3: Check secure context
const isSecureContext = window.isSecureContext || 
  window.location.protocol === 'https:' || 
  window.location.hostname === 'localhost';
```

**Why**: Modern browser extensions don't always inject globals. The new approach uses multiple detection methods for better reliability.

### **3. React.StrictMode Protection**

```typescript
// Use ref to prevent double initialization
const initializationRef = useRef(false);

if (initializationRef.current) {
  console.log('🔄 HashConnect already initializing, skipping...');
  return;
}
```

**Why**: React.StrictMode in development can cause double initialization, breaking HashConnect. This prevents that issue.

### **4. Enhanced Logging**

```typescript
console.log('🔍 Starting HashPack detection...');
console.log('📡 Step 1: Detecting HashPack...');
console.log('📡 Step 2: Creating HashConnect instance...');
console.log('📡 Step 3: Preparing app metadata...');
console.log('📡 Step 4: Initializing HashConnect with testnet...');
console.log('📡 Step 5: Setting up event listeners...');
console.log('📡 Step 6: Checking for existing pairings...');
console.log('🎉 HashConnect initialization completed successfully!');
```

**Why**: Clear step-by-step logging helps debug detection and initialization issues.

### **5. HTTPS Development Script**

**New Script**: `scripts/dev-https.js`
```bash
npm run dev:https
```

**Why**: Provides an easy way to start the app with HTTPS for HashPack compatibility.

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Development with HashPack**

1. **Start with HTTPS:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   ```

2. **Or use regular dev (now with HTTPS):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the app:**
   - URL: `https://localhost:5173`
   - Accept the self-signed certificate if prompted

### **Production**

The app will automatically use HTTPS in production builds.

## 🔍 **Detection Methods**

The new implementation uses **4 detection methods**:

1. **Extension Manifest Check**
   - Looks for HashPack in `chrome.runtime.getManifest()`
   - Checks extension name for "hashpack" or "hedera"

2. **Extension ID Ping**
   - Tries to communicate with known HashPack extension IDs
   - Uses `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` to ping extensions

3. **Global Object Check**
   - Checks for `hashconnect`, `HashConnect`, `hashpack`, `HashPack`
   - Fallback method for older detection

4. **Secure Context Check**
   - Ensures HTTPS or localhost context
   - HashPack requires secure context to function

## 📊 **Expected Console Output**

### **Successful Detection:**
```
🔍 Starting HashPack detection...
🔍 Chrome extension manifest found: {name: "HashPack", ...}
✅ HashPack extension detected via manifest
📡 Step 1: Detecting HashPack...
📡 Step 2: Creating HashConnect instance...
📡 Step 3: Preparing app metadata...
📡 Step 4: Initializing HashConnect with testnet...
✅ HashConnect initialized successfully
📡 Step 5: Setting up event listeners...
📡 Step 6: Checking for existing pairings...
🎉 HashConnect initialization completed successfully!
```

### **HashPack Not Installed:**
```
🔍 Starting HashPack detection...
🔍 No extension manifest found
⚠️ HashPack not detected, but continuing with initialization...
📡 Step 1: Detecting HashPack...
📡 Step 2: Creating HashConnect instance...
...
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "HashPack not detected"**
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure HashPack extension is installed and unlocked
2. Use `npm run dev:https` for HTTPS
3. Check browser console for detailed detection logs

### **Issue: "Connection failed"**
**Solution**:
1. Make sure HashPack is unlocked
2. Switch HashPack to Testnet network
3. Check for popup blockers
4. Try clicking the HashPack extension icon

### **Issue: "Double initialization"**
**Solution**: 
- The new implementation prevents this with `initializationRef`
- React.StrictMode is handled gracefully

## ✅ **Benefits**

1. **🔒 HTTPS Support** - Required for HashPack compatibility
2. **🎯 Modern Detection** - Doesn't rely on window injection
3. **🛡️ StrictMode Safe** - Prevents double initialization
4. **📊 Better Logging** - Clear step-by-step debugging
5. **🔄 Multiple Methods** - Fallback detection strategies
6. **⚡ Performance** - Efficient initialization process

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Install HashPack extension** from Chrome Web Store
2. **Start the app**: `npm run dev:https`
3. **Open browser console** to see detection logs
4. **Click "Connect HashPack"** button
5. **Verify connection** in HashPack popup

The implementation is now robust, modern, and compatible with the latest HashPack extension! 🎉
